### Pneumonia Diagnosis with Deep Learning
![](chest_xray/train/PNEUMONIA/person1010_virus_1695.jpeg)

In this repository a pretrained ResNet50 Convolutional Neural was retrained to perform diagnosis of pneumonia
through a process known as transfer learning. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 90%. To check out the
Exploratory Data Analysis click ![here](EDA.ipynb). To see the how the transfer learning was performed click ![here](X-Ray%20Classification.ipynb).
